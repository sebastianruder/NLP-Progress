# Coreference resolution

Coreference resolution is the task of clustering mentions in text that refer to the same underlying real world entities.

Example:

```
               +-----------+
               |           |
I voted for Obama because he was most aligned with my values", she said.
 |                                                 |            |
 +-------------------------------------------------+------------+
```

"I", "my", and "she" belong to the same cluster and "Obama" and "he" belong to the same cluster.

### CoNLL 2012

Experiments are conducted on the data of the [CoNLL-2012 shared task](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W12-4501), which
uses OntoNotes coreference annotations. Papers
report the precision, recall, and F1 of the MUC, B3, and CEAFÏ†4 metrics using the official
CoNLL-2012 evaluation scripts. The main evaluation metric is the average F1 of the three metrics.
