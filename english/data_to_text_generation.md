# Data-to-Text Generation

**Data-to-Text Generation (D2T NLG)** can be described as Natural Language Generation from structured input.
<!-- is a task of NLG where the **textual output** is generated using **structured input** (such as tables or graphs). -->
Unlike Machine Translation or Question Answering tasks (also referred as **Text-to-Text Generation, or T2T NLG**) where requirement is to generate textual output using some unstructured textual input only, here the input will be provided in a structured format such as tables or knowledge graphs <sup>[[1]](#myfootnote1)</sup>.
