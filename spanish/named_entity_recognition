# Named entity recognition

Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of tagging entities in text with their corresponding type.
Approaches typically use BIO notation, which differentiates the beginning (B) and the inside (I) of entities.
O is used for non-entity tokens.

Example:

| Mark | Watney | visited | Mars |
| --- | ---| --- | --- |
| B-PER | I-PER | O | B-LOC |

### CANTEMIST 2020

The [CANTEMIST-NER 2020 task](https://temu.bsc.es/cantemist/) consists of Spanish oncology clinical reports corpus tagged with one entity type (MORFOLOGIA_NEOPLASIA). 
The CANTEMIST shared task has as well an entity linking subtrack (CANTEMIST-NORM) and a document indexing subtrack (CANTEMIST-CODING)
Models are evaluated based on span-based F1 on the test set. [Evaluation scripts] (https://github.com/TeMU-BSC/cantemist-evaluation-library)
